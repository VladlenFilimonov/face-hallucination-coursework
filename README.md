## 1. Project Overview:
   - The project aims to develop a Face-Hallucination system capable of generating high-resolution facial images from low-resolution inputs. The system will utilize deep learning techniques to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed images.

## 2. Objectives:
   - Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture suitable for Face-Hallucination.
   - Train the CNN using a dataset of low-resolution and corresponding high-resolution facial images.
   - Evaluate the performance of the system using quantitative metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
   - Implement a user interface for interacting with the Face-Hallucination system.

## 3. Technical Requirements:
   - Programming Language: Python
   - Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
   - Dataset: Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ) thumbnails 128x128
   - Hardware: GPU with CUDA support for accelerated training
   - Software Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 4. System Architecture:
   - The Face-Hallucination system will consist of the following components:
     - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The core component for generating high-resolution facial images using the SRGAN model.
     - User Interface: Allows users to input low-resolution images and visualize the generated high-resolution results.
   
### 4.1 Scripts Description:
   - `data_loader`: Responsible for loading and preprocessing the training and validation datasets.
   - `inference`: Script for generating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs using the trained SRGAN model.
   - `loss`: Contains the implementation of adversarial and reconstruction loss functions used during model training.
   - `model`: Defines the architecture of the SRGAN model and its components.
   - `train`: Script for training the SRGAN model, incorporating techniques such as batch normalization and residual connections.

## 5. Model Training:
   - Train the CNN using a combination of adversarial and reconstruction loss functions inherent to the SRGAN model.
   - Utilize techniques such as batch normalization and residual connections to stabilize training and improve convergence.
   - Validate the trained model using a separate validation set to ensure generalization.


## 6. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Evaluate the performance of the Face-Hallucination system using the following metrics:
     - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
     - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
     - Visual inspection by human evaluators

## 7. Model Persistence:
   - Implement model persistence to save trained model weights and architecture for future use.
   - Use format PTH for saving and loading the model.

## 8. Deliverables:
   - Trained Face-Hallucination model weights and architecture.
